        <h1>Brief History of Visual Novels</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="histo">
        <p>Visual novels have evolved significantly since their inception in the 1980s. Initially emerging in Japan, they combined elements of interactive storytelling with accompanying visuals, akin to a digital choose-your-own-adventure book. One of the earliest examples is "Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken," released in 1983, which featured simple graphics and text-based interactions.

            Throughout the late 1980s and 1990s, visual novels gained popularity in Japan, particularly on personal computers and gaming consoles. Titles like "Dōkyūsei" (1992) and "Kana: Little Sister" (1999) introduced more complex narratives and character-driven stories, often with branching paths and multiple endings based on player choices.
            
            The 2000s marked a significant expansion of the visual novel genre, both in Japan and internationally. Games like "Clannad" (2004) and "Fate/stay night" (2004) gained widespread acclaim for their compelling narratives and emotional depth. With the rise of digital distribution platforms, visual novels became more accessible to a global audience, leading to an increase in localization and translation efforts.
            
            In recent years, visual novels have continued to innovate, incorporating elements of other genres such as romance, mystery, and fantasy, as well as experimenting with new gameplay mechanics and storytelling techniques. They remain a popular medium for narrative-driven gaming experiences, with a diverse range of themes and styles catering to various tastes and preferences.</p>
