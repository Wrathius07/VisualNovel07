            From my personal experience, many visual novels are considered masterpieces by some, while others may find them excessive and fail to see their value. 
            In my opinion, the greatest visual novel I've encountered so far is "Umineko: When They Cry." I genuinely believe that this work of fiction has the potential to alter the trajectory of a person's life. Upon completing this visual novel, my perspective underwent a profound transformation, and I felt as though I had transcended mere existence. 
            The philosophical depth of this visual novel is astonishing, as it explores the belief systems of the universe in a remarkably creative yet slightly complex manner that deeply engages the reader. Sometimes, I even wonder if the author of this visual novel, Ryukishi07, is truly human. However, joking aside, I wholeheartedly recommend this visual novel to everyone, regardless of their level of experience, as it is truly worth the investment of time, despite its considerable length. 
            Interestingly, this visual novel surpasses the entire Harry Potter series in length, totaling 1,138,003 words.

        <p>If you're more inclined towards gameplay, then Danganronpa might be the right choice for you. This visual novel comprises three main titles that form a sequential series: Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc, Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair, and Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony. 
            In my personal experience, I found this visual novel to be highly entertaining due to its diverse range of interactive elements. For instance, players can engage with in-game characters and enhance their relationships through various interactions. While Danganronpa follows the typical murder mystery format of visual novels, it offers additional gameplay elements. 
            However, from a narrative standpoint, Danganronpa may not be exceptionally well-crafted for a visual novel, but it still manages to deliver an enjoyable experience. 
            This aspect makes it particularly beginner-friendly, as it doesn't demand advanced reading skills and is genuinely enjoyable to play.
